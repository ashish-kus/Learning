/*pythagorus triplet  âŠ¿
  Pythagorean triples are a^2+b^2 = c^2 where a, b and c are the three positive
  integers. These triples are represented as (a,b,c). Here, a is the
  perpendicular, b is the base and c is the hypotenuse of the right-angled
  triangle. The most known and smallest triplets are (3,4,5).
